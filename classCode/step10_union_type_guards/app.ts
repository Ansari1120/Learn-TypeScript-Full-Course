/*Note on Type Guards:
A common pattern in JavaScript is to use typeof or instanceof to examine the type of an expression at runtime. 
TypeScript now understands these conditions and will change type inference accordingly when used in an if block.
This is called a type guard.*/

let x: any = "Tom"; //Line A
if(typeof x === 'string') { //Line B
   console.log(x.lengthX);// Error, 'lengthX' does not exist on 'string' but 'lenght' does
}
// x is still any here
x.unknown();// OK
